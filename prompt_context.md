We are building are website for Paras to surprise Julie with this surprise proposal site and it details our trip to italy.
Starting out in the dolomites with a surprise proposal in the mountain and then going into Milan with lots of shopping
and city exploration. The website is hosted on github pages and thus is a static webpage just relying on html,css, and javascript + any libraries or frameworks we can combine with.

The main features of the site are:
- a stunning landing page, for the mountain dolomites + proposal portion of the trip
- a stunning landing page, for Milan and the city/adventures part of the trip
- A page with an intinerary of the activites with some activites having dedicated pages and interactive elements
- A series of 4 mini games leading up to the proposal day, such as a lottery scratch off, flashlight effect. fog of war map

Some stretch goals for the project:
- Have a list of all our dates, just the name of the place and date
